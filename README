Attach a delete order method to the admin/order class
Currently orders deleted are permanently deleted from the database. 
TODO - Check if user has the correct user previlages (ie. admin) to call the function *might be irrelevant*
     - Should only enable during development/test ENV?
     - When users delete last order on pagination page, it should redirect to previous page, currently just shows nothing.
     - Consider adding a (all) or (none) checkbox selector link.
     - Refactor code to be a better fit for future releases.
